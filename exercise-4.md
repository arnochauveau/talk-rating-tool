# Exercise 4: Pipes

1. Create a custom pipe `oddEven` or generate one with `ng g pipe`.
2. Make sure your pipe is added to the declarations property of the appModule
3. In the pipe the functionality to add `odd` or `even` to the input value. eg. `2 even`
4. Hook up the pipe to the value of the `<input><input/>` that we added in the previous exercise.
