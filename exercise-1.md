# Exercise 1: Getting to know Angular and the CLI.

1. Generate a new Angular project using the Angular CLI by running `ng new` in the root of this project. Follow the prompt and use the following options: name: 'talk-rating-tool', angular routing: 'yes', stylesheet format: 'scss'.

2. Generate a component `'hello-world'` with the Angular CLI (`ng g component`). Make sure the component is added to the `declarations` of the `app.module.ts` file
3. In the newly generated component, add a property `title` with value `hello world!`.

4. Delete the default template of the `app.component.ts` and edit it so that the `hello-world component` is rendered in the `appComponent`
